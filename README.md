The requirments for the app I was set up to devolpe felt like a bit of overkill when I first set out on the project but as I went through the process they began to make more sense. I made a calender app, that allowed you to make notes along with the vents, and was able to have more than one account so multiple people could use it. Thus the screens that were needed included, the login screen, a monthly calender, along with a more detaile weekly and daily screen. Creating these I tried to make everything as simple as possible to help with user UI, while also making every function clear and intuitive. There were many challenges I faced while devolping this app, the initial planning was the fun part, even figuring out the code wasn't so bad, but I typically have trouble making code for different things work together. Android studios was alaos a bit of a learning curve. I think the layout and UI is the best designed aspect of my project.
